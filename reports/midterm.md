# MidTerm Notes

## Problem (Emelie):
Our project studies how the gut microbiome of infants changes during the first six months of life and whether these changes relate to behavior and sleep patterns. We analyze samples taken at 2, 4, and 6 months to track how microbial composition and diversity develop over time. The microbiome typically becomes more diverse and stable as new bacterial groups establish and early colonizers decrease in dominance. By comparing these microbial trends with measures of sleep rhythm, sleep quality, and behavior, we aim to explore possible connections between early gut development and infant well-being.

try to predict behavioral, sleep rhythm and sleep quality with the microbiome composition, diversity. 

Try to describe the change of microbiome over time. Find common charasteristics across development.
