Early-life antibiotic exposures, cesarean section, and formula feeding could disrupt microbiome establishment and adversely affect health later in life. We profiled microbial development during the first 2 years of life in a cohort of 43 U.S. infants and identified multiple disturbances associated with antibiotic exposures, cesarean section, and formula feeding. These exposures contributed to altered establishment of maternal bacteria, delayed microbiome development, and altered α-diversity. These findings illustrate the complexity of early-life microbiome development and its sensitivity to perturbation.},

	abstract = {Microbiome data are sparse and high dimensional, so effective visualization of these data requires dimensionality reduction. To date, the most commonly used method for dimensionality reduction in the microbiome is calculation of between-sample microbial differences (beta diversity), followed by principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is an alternative method that can reduce the dimensionality of beta diversity distance matrices. Here, we demonstrate the benefits and limitations of using UMAP for dimensionality reduction on microbiome data. Using real data, we demonstrate that UMAP can improve the representation of clusters, especially when the clusters are composed of multiple subgroups. Additionally, we show that UMAP provides improved correlation of biological variation along a gradient with a reduced number of coordinates of the resulting embedding. Finally, we provide parameter recommendations that emphasize the preservation of global geometry. We therefore conclude that UMAP should be routinely used as a complementary visualization method for microbiome beta diversity studies.
IMPORTANCE UMAP provides an additional method to visualize microbiome data. The method is extensible to any beta diversity metric used with PCoA, and our results demonstrate that UMAP can indeed improve visualization quality and correspondence with biological and technical variables of interest. The software to perform this analysis is available under an open-source license and can be obtained at https://github.com/knightlab-analyses/umap-microbiome-benchmarking; additionally, we have provided a QIIME 2 plugin for UMAP at https://github.com/biocore/q2-umap.},

In recent studies, HMOs have been shown to have a variety of functional roles in the development of infants. Because HMOs are not digested by infants, they act as metabolic substrates for certain bacteria, helping to establish the infant’s gut microbiota. By encouraging the growth of advantageous intestinal bacteria, these sugars function as prebiotics and produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are essential for gut health. HMOs can also specifically reduce harmful microbes and viruses binding to the gut epithelium, preventing illness. HMO addition to infant formula is safe and promotes healthy development, infection prevention, and microbiota. Current infant formulas frequently contain oligosaccharides (OSs) that differ structurally from those found in human milk, making it unlikely that they would reproduce the unique effects of HMOs. However, there is a growing trend in producing OSs resembling HMOs, but limited data make it unclear whether HMOs offer additional therapeutic benefits compared to non-human OSs. Better knowledge of how the human mammary gland synthesizes HMOs could direct the development of technologies that yield a broad variety of complex HMOs with OS compositions that closely mimic human milk. This review explores HMOs’ complex nature and vital role in infant health, examining maternal variation in HMO composition and its contributing factors. It highlights recent technological advances enabling large-scale studies on HMO composition and its effects on infant health. Furthermore, HMOs’ multifunctional roles in biological processes such as infection prevention, brain development, and gut microbiota and immune response regulation are investigated. The structural distinctions between HMOs and other mammalian OSs in infant formulas are discussed, with a focus on the trend toward producing more precise replicas of HMOs found in human milk.},

A cornerstone of NGS is the quantification of RNA or DNA presence as counts. However, these counts are not counts per se: their magnitude is determined arbitrarily by the sequencing depth, not by the input material. Consequently, counts must undergo normalization prior to use. Conventional normalization methods require a set of assumptions: they assume that the majority of features are unchanged and that all environments under study have the same carrying capacity for nucleotide synthesis. These assumptions are often untestable and may not hold when heterogeneous samples are compared.Methods developed within the field of compositional data analysis offer a general solution that is assumption-free and valid for all data. Herein, we synthesize the extant literature to provide a concise guide on how to apply compositional data analysis to NGS count data.In highlighting the limitations of total library size, effective library size, and spike-in normalizations, we propose the log-ratio transformation as a general solution to answer the question, “Relative to some important activity of the cell, what is changing?”},

Sixty fecal samples were collected from a healthy infant along with a diary of diet and health status. Analysis of {\textgreater}300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient. In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of ≈500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes facilitating lactate utilization, and that functional genes involved in plant polysaccharide metabolism were present before the introduction of solid food, priming the infant gut for an adult diet. However, ingestion of table foods caused a sustained increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, elevated fecal short chain fatty acid levels, enrichment of genes associated with carbohydrate utilization, vitamin biosynthesis, and xenobiotic degradation, and a more stable community composition, all of which are characteristic of the adult microbiome. This study revealed that seemingly chaotic shifts in the microbiome are associated with life events; however, additional experiments ought to be conducted to assess how different infants respond to similar life events.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
The human gut microbiota is engaged in multiple interactions affecting host health during the host's entire life span. Microbes colonize the neonatal gut immediately following birth. The establishment and interactive development of this early gut microbiota are believed to be (at least partially) driven and modulated by specific compounds present in human milk. It has been shown that certain genomes of infant gut commensals, in particular those of bifidobacterial species, are genetically adapted to utilize specific glycans of this human secretory fluid, thus representing a very intriguing example of host-microbe coevolution, where both partners are believed to benefit. In recent years, various metagenomic studies have tried to dissect the composition and functionality of the infant gut microbiome and to explore the distribution across the different ecological niches of the infant gut biogeography of the corresponding microbial consortia, including those corresponding to bacteria and viruses, in healthy and ill subjects. Such analyses have linked certain features of the microbiota/microbiome, such as reduced diversity or aberrant composition, to intestinal illnesses in infants or disease states that are manifested at later stages of life, including asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic disorders. Thus, a growing number of studies have reported on how the early human gut microbiota composition/development may affect risk factors related to adult health conditions. This concept has fueled the development of strategies to shape the infant microbiota composition based on various functional food products. In this review, we describe the infant microbiota, the mechanisms that drive its establishment and composition, and how microbial consortia may be molded by natural or artificial interventions. Finally, we discuss the relevance of key microbial players of the infant gut microbiota, in particular bifidobacteria, with respect to their role in health and disease.},

We report a longitudinal study of the gut microbiome based on DNA sequence analysis of monthly stool samples and clinical information from 39 children, about half of whom received multiple courses of antibiotics during the first 3 years of life. Whereas the gut microbiome of most children born by vaginal delivery was dominated by Bacteroides species, the four children born by cesarean section and about 20\% of vaginally born children lacked Bacteroides in the first 6 to 18 months of life. Longitudinal sampling, coupled with whole-genome shotgun sequencing, allowed detection of strain-level variation as well as the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes. The microbiota of antibiotic-treated children was less diverse in terms of both bacterial species and strains, with some species often dominated by single strains. In addition, we observed short-term composition changes between consecutive samples from children treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance genes carried on microbial chromosomes showed a peak in abundance after antibiotic treatment followed by a sharp decline, whereas some genes carried on mobile elements persisted longer after antibiotic therapy ended. Our results highlight the value of high-density longitudinal sampling studies with high-resolution strain profiling for studying the establishment and response to perturbation of the infant gut microbiome.},

	abstract = {Characterizing the dynamics of microbial community succession in the infant gut microbiome is crucial for understanding child health and development, but no normative model currently exists. Here, we estimate child age using gut microbial taxonomic relative abundances from metagenomes, with high temporal resolution (±3 months) for the first 1.5 years of life. Using 3154 samples from 1827 infants across 12 countries, we trained a random forest model, achieving a root mean square error of 2.56 months. We identified key taxonomic predictors of age, including declines in Bifidobacterium spp. and increases in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Lachnospiraceae. Microbial succession patterns are conserved across infants from diverse human populations, suggesting universal developmental trajectories. Functional analysis confirmed trends in key microbial genes involved in feeding transitions and dietary exposures. This model provides a normative benchmark of “microbiome age” for assessing early gut maturation that may be used alongside other measures of child development.},

	abstract = {Background We present q2-boots, a QIIME 2 plugin that facilitates bootstrapped and rarefaction-based microbiome diversity analysis. This plugin provides eight new actions that allow users to apply any of thirty different alpha diversity metrics and twenty-two beta diversity metrics to bootstrapped or rarefied feature tables, using a single QIIME 2 Pipeline command, or more granular QIIME 2 Action commands. Results Given a feature table, an even sampling depth, and the number of iterations to perform (n), the command qiime boots core-metrics will resample the feature table n times and compute alpha and beta diversity metrics on each resampled table. The results will be integrated in summary data artifacts that are identical in structure and type to results that would be generated by applying diversity metrics to a single table. This enables all the same downstream analytic tools to be applied to these tables and ensures that all collected data is considered when computing microbiome diversity metrics. Conclusions A challenge of this work was deciding how to integrate distance matrices that were computed on n resampled feature tables, as a simple average of pairwise distances (median or mean) does not account for the structure of distance matrices. q2-boots provides three options, and we show here that the results of these approaches are highly correlated. q2-boots is free and open source.

	abstract = {Emerging evidence supports a bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiome and sleep, partly mediated by the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Circadian rhythms appear to influence early developmental processes and may play a role in shaping this relationship. While infancy is a critical window for both gut microbiota establishment and the maturation of sleep regulation, the role of gut bacteria in modulating infant sleep remains poorly understood.
In this longitudinal study, we performed continuous within-subject sampling (monitoring across 48 hours) in 20 infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age to examine associations between the establishment of gut microbiota and sleep patterns. We hypothesized that microbial diversity and sleep rhythmicity would be linked across both short (diurnal) and long (monthly) time scales. Gut microbiota profiles were characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing; gut melatonin concentrations were measured; and sleep metrics were quantified through wearable actimetry, parent-reported 24-hour sleep diaries, and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ). Parents additionally completed the Baby Care Questionnaire (BCQ), assessing parenting style, and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), evaluating infant behavioral development.
In some infants, alpha diversity followed diurnal rhythmic patterns. Although bacterial rhythmicity was not significantly associated with sleep rhythmicity, as quantified with the Circadian Function Index, infants with higher alpha diversity had more robust sleep rhythmicity (βFaith PD= 0.0721, SE = 0.0337). Infant age emerged as the strongest predictor of both gut microbiota diversity (observed features: βage = 0.101, SE = 0.0172) and gut melatonin concentrations (βage = 0.638, SE = 0.162). For the same age, gut microbiota temporal volatility – an indicator for bacterial community instability – was not associated with sleep patterns. This study demonstrates promising short– and long-term links between gut microbiota diversity and sleep-wake rhythm maturation in infancy. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanistic role of the gut microbiome in sleep development.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a commonly used algorithm for characterizing gene expression changes. However, the currently available tools used to perform GSEA have a limited ability to analyze large datasets, which is particularly problematic for the analysis of single-cell data. To overcome this limitation, we developed a GSEA package in Python (GSEApy), which could efficiently analyze large single-cell datasets.
RESULTS: We present a package (GSEApy) that performs GSEA in either the command line or Python environment. GSEApy uses a Rust implementation to enable it to calculate the same enrichment statistic as GSEA for a collection of pathways. The Rust implementation of GSEApy is 3-fold faster than the Numpy version of GSEApy (v0.10.8) and uses {\textgreater}4-fold less memory. GSEApy also provides an interface between Python and Enrichr web services, as well as for BioMart. The Enrichr application programming interface enables GSEApy to perform over-representation analysis for an input gene list. Furthermore, GSEApy consists of several tools, each designed to facilitate a particular type of enrichment analysis.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The new GSEApy with Rust extension is deposited in PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/gseapy/. The GSEApy source code is freely available at https://github.com/zqfang/GSEApy. Also, the documentation website is available at https://gseapy.rtfd.io/.

	abstract = {Datasets collected by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of 16S rRNA gene amplimers, metagenomes or metatranscriptomes are commonplace and being used to study human disease states, ecological differences between sites, and the built environment. There is increasing awareness that microbiome datasets generated by HTS are compositional because they have an arbitrary total imposed by the instrument. However, many investigators are either unaware of this or assume specific properties of the compositional data. The purpose of this review is to alert investigators to the dangers inherent in ignoring the compositional nature of the data, and point out that HTS datasets derived from microbiome studies can and should be treated as compositions at all stages of analysis. We briefly introduce compositional data, illustrate the pathologies that occur when compositional data are analyzed inappropriately, and finally give guidance and point to resources and examples for the analysis of microbiome datasets using compositional data analysis.},
