    "## Collapse feature table and metadata\n",
    "The number of samples collected from each infant at a given timepoint varies, depending on how often the child produces a stool. The `sample_number` column in `data/raw/metadata_per_sample.tsv` indicates the order in which the samples were taken.\n",

    "We decided to defined one reference sample per timepoint for each infant by averaging the abundance of each ASV. The metadata was then collapsed so that each infant has a single representative sample per timepoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was done in three steps: \n",
    "1. **Create an intermediate metadata file**  \n",
    "    A new column, infant_time, was added to the existing `metadata.tsv`, combining `infant_id` and `timepoint`. The updated metadata was then saved as an intermediate file (`infant_time_metadata.tsv`).\n",
    "    All samples from the same infant at the same timepoint share the same `infant_time` entry.\n",
    "    This field is later used to collapse the feature table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collapse the feature table**  \n",
    "    Using `--qiime feature-table group`, we grouped features by the `infant_time` column.\n",
    "    The mean-ceiling method was applied to average ASV abundances across the samples, producing one representative table entry per infant per timepoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collapse the metadata**  \n",
    "    The original `sampleid` column was removed, and infant_time was renamed to `sampleid`, which becomes the new unique identifier. The metadata was then collapsed to have one representative entry per infant per timepoint"
